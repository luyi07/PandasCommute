# PandasCommute
This is a small code to be used in nuclear structure calculations. 
It helps evaluate both non-energy-weighted and energy-weighted sum rules of one-body transitions in the shell model. 
A more detailed Guide.pdf file can be found in PandasCommute/docs/.
The code is still being updated, as I'm expanding its functions.

Acknowledgement: I am indebted to Calvin Johnson for his help and contributions. When I code and optimize this, he has been sending me feedbacks and telling me things via emails. Great teacher.
